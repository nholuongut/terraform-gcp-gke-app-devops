# Implement Continuous Integration for a simple application on Google Cloud Platform (GKE)

# Pre-requisites
- A GCP account with billing enabled and its authorization key
- Basic knowledge of Terraform â€” and having it installed on your local
- Basic knowledge of Helm â€” and having it installed on your local
- - Basic knowledge of Kubernetes
Minikube (only if you want to try it locally first)

# The repo
## The repository we are going to use is a public one published and maintained by the GCP team. It is a sample cloud-first application with 10 microservices showcasing Kubernetes, Istio, and gRPC

Alright, youâ€™ve reached the end of the tutorial! Youâ€™ve just mastered how to put together a full-stack microservice app on Kubernetes using for a simple application on Google Cloud Platform (GKE), Pretty cool, huh?

With Terraform, youâ€™ve set up all the bits and pieces you need, making sure your infrastructure is consistent no matter where youâ€™re deploying it. And then, Helm swoops in to make deploying your Kubernetes apps a breeze with its charts. Itâ€™s like magic!

Now that youâ€™ve got these tricks up your sleeve, youâ€™re all set to dive into the wild world of DevOps and cloud-native apps. So go ahead, play around, and keep building awesome stuff!
